Real-time Sleep Stage Classification with HRV from MAX30102 Sensor on Raspberry Pi  
[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

This repository enables real-time classification of sleep stages using Heart Rate Variability (HRV) signals measured with the MAX30102 sensor on Raspberry Pi.  
The system uses preprocessing, feature extraction, and deep learning (LSTM-based) classification pipelines from the [`sleep-analysis`](https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/sleep_analysis) framework.
